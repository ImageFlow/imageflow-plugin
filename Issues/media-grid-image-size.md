# Media Grid: Grid Image Size

**Problem**: Grid images are neither large enough to make detailed decisions, nor small enough to allow rapid library scanning.

**Solution**:   We should allow users to toggle betwween small and large images sizes. The small should be a true thumbnail, and the large should be a full-width image to allow for details to be seen no matter the screen size.
