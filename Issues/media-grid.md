## Media Grid:

+ __[Users are presented with options they do not need, or cannot use.](https://github.com/ImageFlow/imageflow-plugin/blob/master/Issues/media-grid-options.md)__

+ __[Adding Files is hidden in a separate tab from selecting media.](https://github.com/ImageFlow/imageflow-plugin/blob/master/Issues/media-grid-upload.md)__

+ __[On all but mobile, the column-based library layout presents too much focus on library at all times and crowds screen for later steps.](https://github.com/ImageFlow/imageflow-plugin/blob/master/Issues/media-grid-columns.md)__

+ __[On all but mobile, the left sidebar takes up space within the media grid, but is largely empty, and many of the choices are only useful *after* a user has chosen their media.](https://github.com/ImageFlow/imageflow-plugin/blob/master/Issues/media-grid-left-sidebar.md)__

+ __[On mobile choosing an image on mobile, reveals the right sidebar (attachment details) which covers the grid and cannot be hidden.](https://github.com/ImageFlow/imageflow-plugin/blob/master/Issues/media-grid-right-sidebar.md)__

+ __[On mobile clicking 'Expand Details' hides 'Insert into Post'](https://github.com/ImageFlow/imageflow-plugin/blob/master/Issues/expand-details.md)__

+ __[Grid images are neither large enough to make detailed decisions, nor small enough to allow rapid library scanning.](https://github.com/ImageFlow/imageflow-plugin/blob/master/Issues/media-grid-image-size.md)__
	
+ __Multi-select in the grid is unclear on desktop, broken on mobile.(https://github.com/ImageFlow/imageflow-plugin/blob/master/Issues/media-grid-multiselect.md)__

+ __There is no clear path to edit an image - only a small link in the right sidebar(https://github.com/ImageFlow/imageflow-plugin/blob/master/Issues/media-grid-edit.md)__

+ __The media grid is not currently extensible by developers(https://github.com/ImageFlow/imageflow-plugin/blob/master/Issues/media-grid-extensible.md)__

  A menu of 'more' options should be added for developers to hook other actions for media to. These can have context (media type, amount) and bubble up as needed.
