# Media Grid: Left Sidebar

**Problem**: On all but mobile, the left sidebar takes up space within the media grid, but is largely empty, and many of the choices are only useful *after* a user has chosen their media.

**Solution**:  The left bar should be removed, and all of the actions that are options should be presented in context of the media the user selects.

**Current View: User selects 'Create Gallery'**

User selects 'Create Gallery', the media library is limited to images only, but this is largely invisible to the user. The grid looks largely the same.

User can now select a single image and insert it into the post as a gallery, which makes no sense.

**Proposed View: User selects multiple images**

After user second image the create gallery button appears.

## Tasks

To achieve the new screen:
- remove left hand menu
- make media grid full width of screen
- reveal contextual buttons based on user action
- user selects 2nd image: reveal additional “create gallery” button
