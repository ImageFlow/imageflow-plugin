# Edit Picture Process:

**Problem**: Crop tool is confusing. Appears selected but none cropping area is visible until user clicks the picture.
Aspect ratio is selected by numbers.

**Solution**: Edit picture is a step-by-step process, where picture is the main focus all the time, having all the tools on top, and "Apply" and "Cancel" at the bottom.
Create an optional view mode. In the media grid, user has a toggle to activate and disable 'Full Width View" on the top right corner.
