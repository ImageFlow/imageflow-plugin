# Media Grid: options

**Problem**: To upload a file, the user has to click on a separate tab.

**Solution**: Integrate the add media button with the media grid. This + button will indicate to the user that an image is being added to the library. The user can click the button or drag and drop onto the media grid.

## Tasks

To achieve the new screen:
- remove the “Upload Files” tab
- add + button (similar to the one currently in use in Themes, though the media grid button comes at the start of the grid)
