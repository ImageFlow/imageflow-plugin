**Problem**: Users are presented with too many options. They can either insert media, create gallery, set featured image, insert from URL, or upload files. When opening the modal, the interface should be focused on what the user wants to do: select their media.

**Solution**: reduce user interface and reveal actions based on the user’s actions. This will make the UI intuitive to the task that the user wants to achieve. It will also guide their actions towards their goal. 

**User selects 1 image**

User selects 1 image and options are revealed for dealing with 1 image. These are:
- insert
- edit info

**User selects multiple images**

After user second image the create gallery button appears. 

## Tasks

To achieve the new screen:
- remove left hand menu
- make media grid full width of screen
- reveal contextual buttons based on user action
- user selects 1 image: reveal “insert”, “edit info”, and “edit image” and “[…]” buttons
- user selects 2nd image: reveal additional “create gallery” button
