# Media Grid: Right Sidebar on Mobile

**Problem**: On mobile, selecting an image, reveals the right sidebar (containing Attachment Details) which covers half of the grid and cannot be hidden.

**Solution**:  The attachment details should be accessed in another state, leaving the grid view for media selection only.
