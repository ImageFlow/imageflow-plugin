# Media Grid: Expand Details

**Problem**: On mobile, when a user has selected an image and is shown the Attachment Details clicking 'Expand Details' hides the 'Insert into Post' button.

**Solution**:  The attachment details should be accessed in another state, leaving the grid view for media selection only.
