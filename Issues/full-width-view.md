# Full Width View:

**Problem**: Users should be able to see pictures uncropped and taking advantage of the size of the device where the 'media modal' is being presented.

**Solution**: Create an optional view mode. In the media grid, user has a toggle to activate and disable 'Full Width View" on the top right corner.

Current view desktop:

Proposed 'full width' view desktop:
(One picture is already selected, so user can take several actions: insert, edit info, edit picture, ...)

**User moves right**

User can move right or left to explore the images. In desktop user will see arrows on the sides. On mobile user should use the "swipe" event.

## Tasks

To achieve the new screen:
- create room for the new toggle
- create new icons for "grid view/full width view"
- work on a new view mode that allows the user see picture using all the available space
- create controllers for right and left shift
As in "grid view":
- user selects 1 image: reveal “insert”, “edit info”, and “edit image” and “[…]” buttons
- user selects 2nd image: reveal additional “create gallery” button
